%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
  Changing the genre of a song is one of the methods used when compositing music.
  To the best of our knowledge, musicians usually add their new ideas to the song,
  while trying to keep most of the special characteristics of the original song when arranging music.
  Similar to other artistic tasks that require human creativity,
  converting the genre of a song takes a significant amount of time and effort.
  In this project, we propose a method to translate a music genre by using machine-learning,
  which can generate a new song with comparably less amount of time than humans.
  Specifically, we utilized cycleGAN based model to translate a soundtrack to another soundtrack.\par
  Due to the complexity and difficulties of dealing with audio data,
  our model is able to handle files written with MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) specification only with
  specific characteristics.
  In the near future,
  we expect to expand our project to use regular audio files rather than MIDI to do our tasks to generalize our model.
  By doing so, we hope our model to be used for the general public without further modifications.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

In this project, our goal is to change the genre of a music track, given a set of user inputs 
containing song and the desired genre. To accomplish the goal, the main model that we are going to 
consider is CycleGAN~\cite{zhu2017unpaired}-based model. Though Isola et al. proposed this 
architecture for unpaired Image-to-Image translation, we are hoping that this model with a proper
modification of the structure would accept relative information from audio tracks.

\section{Related Work}

Related work should be discussed here. This is an example of a citation \cite{mirjalili2018gender}. To format the citations properly, put the
corresponding references into the bibliography.bib file. You can obtain
BibTeX-formatted references for the "bib" file from Google Scholar 
(\url{https://scholar.google.com}), for example, by clicking on the 
double-quote character under a citation and then selecting \mbox{"BibTeX"} as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:google-scholar-1col} and 
Figure \ref{fig:google-scholar-2col}.

Table \ref{tab:some-table} shows an example for formatting a table.
